From /home/rashi/Desktop/summer intern 2019/tf_ner-master/models/chars_conv_lstm_crf/main.py:215: dropout (from tensorflow.python.layers.core) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use keras.layers.dropout instead.
From /home/rashi/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/layers/core.py:143: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
